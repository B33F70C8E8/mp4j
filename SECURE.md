# Closed-Source Components

Starting from Patch #v1.3, closed-sourced components will be added into the program in order to maintain balance between publicity and usability.
Along with this, all further releases along with this will not have their sources bundled (aka source-code). However, the Source-Code part (this), will not be
altered and will continue as an "open-source" project.

## Effects
If you are building this on your own side, the open source code and snippets will not be affected by any closed source integrations. However,
there may be some performance issues, along with unwanted error codes that may be present in the final release / patch.

## Why?
Closed-Source project helps to maintain usability without the programmer (me) in my belief to focus on making the code as readable and debuggable 
to the public as possible.

The secondary reason, these snippets and code blocks aren't specifically part of the program itself, instead falls into one of these categories:

- There might be legal issues (file formats, encodings, etc.)
- Since they are not part of the same program, using dual-licensing can be confusing during release and building
