This is a simple project board, where future potential futures will be considered to be added. The more X there is, the more likely it is to be added (max 3)

[X] #4 "Launch the media player as a daemon and call upon it when need updating"
      Detailed Description: Instead of handling playing music through the Overseer class and having to strain that object. We can
                            launch a media player daemon as a separate program and we interact with it as it goes. However this 
                            can cause points where the daemon continues to play while our main program has froze and other bugs.

[XXX] #3 "JavaDocs for the entire project, this means commenting the code"
      Detailed Description: None, being worked on :)

[XX] #2 "Ability for the user to change the waveform"
    Detailed Description: Have different versions of the waveform animation and let them be useable and
                          changed in the already ongoing feature [#1]

[XXX] #1 "Fill in the gap between the volume slider and the file selector with a board of buttons"
    Detailed Description: This is already being worked on. It is proposed for this section to host a few
                          buttons that will be able to open and lead to other tasks (Settings, etc.).
